# Task-adaptive-angle-selection-for-Computed-Tomography-based-defect-detection
Welcome to the GitHub repository supporting our paper submission to the Journal of Nondestructive Evaluation. This repository aims to foster collaboration by sharing the code and data essential to our research.
- Shepp-Logan Scenario: This directory hosts code and data for the Shepp-Logan phantom experiments, as detailed in Section 4.2 of our paper. 
- Cylinder Head with Pore Defect: Here, you'll find code for experiments related to the cylinder head scenario incorporating a pore defect. This scenario, described in Section 4.3 of the paper, presents a more complex and realistic case.
- Cylinder Head with Crack Defect: This directory includes code for the cylinder head scenario with a crack defect, aligning with the experiments in Section 4.3.
